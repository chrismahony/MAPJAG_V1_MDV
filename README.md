One sentence summary: Defining the cellular and molecular landscape of the inflamed synovium in juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

Abstract:
Precise application of targeted therapies, guided by molecular pathology, is urgently needed to improve the long-term clinical outcomes of childhood-onset inflammatory arthritis, also known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Progress has been hampered by limited understanding of the cellular basis of inflammation in the target tissue of the disease– the synovial membrane. To address this, we biopsied the inflamed joints of children with JIA, early in the course of their disease, using ultrasound-guided, minimally invasive biopsy techniques. Analysing the acquired tissue samples using single-cell RNA sequencing, multiplexed immunofluorescence and spatial transcriptomics, we define the first cellular atlas of the JIA synovium. 
We identify distinct spatial niches within the inflamed tissue architecture, composed of specific stromal and immune cell populations. Additionally we localise genes linked to arthritis severity and disease risk to effector cell populations, including resident SPP1+ macrophages and fibrin-associated myeloid cells. Combined analyses of matched synovial fluid and peripheral blood reveal differences in cellular composition, signalling pathways and transcriptional programs across these distinct anatomical compartments. Furthermore, our analysis reveals several pathogenic cell populations that are shared with adult-onset inflammatory arthritis, as well as age-associated differences in: tissue vascularity, prominence of innate immunity and enrichment of TGFb-responsive stromal subsets that upregulate expression of disease risk-associated genes. Overall, our findings demonstrate the need for age-specific analyses of synovial tissue pathology to guide targeted treatment strategies in JIA.
